Built as a minimalist landing page, it’s inspired by the spiritual and poetic symbolism of light, the way it reveals, uplifts, and connects. Whether you’re starting your own journey, launching a project, or simply searching for inspiration, LumenSite is meant to illuminate your path.

## About Me

I created LumenSite as more than a template, it's a reflection of how I see the digital world: full of possibility, ready to be illuminated by anyone willing to share their perspective. My passion is building spaces that spark curiosity and connection. If LumenSite helps you launch something brighter, more creative, or just a little more meaningful, then it's done its job.
